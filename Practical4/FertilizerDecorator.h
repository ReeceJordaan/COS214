/**
 * @class FertilizerDecorator
 * @brief A concrete decorator class that adds fertilizer-related functionality to a FarmUnit.
 *
 * The FertilizerDecorator class enhances the functionality of a FarmUnit by adding features related to fertilizers,
 * such as improving crop yield, harvesting crops, and calculating the remaining storage capacity. 
 * It follows the Decorator design pattern to dynamically add these functionalities.
 *
 * @tparam T Thereâ€™s no template method.
 *
 * @ingroup Decorator Pattern
 *
 * @implements This class is a concrete decorator and inherits from Decorator.
 *
 * @author Salome Kalaka
 * @date 09 September 2024
 *
 * @version 1.0
 *
 * @see Decorator class, harvest(), increaseProduction(), and getLeftoverCapacity()
 * @todo Implement specific behavior for fertilizer application and its effects.
 *
 * @warning No warning.
 *
 * @attention Ensure that fertilizer application does not exceed the farm unit's storage capacity.
 *
 * @note The FertilizerDecorator adds fertilizer-related functionalities to an existing farm unit.
