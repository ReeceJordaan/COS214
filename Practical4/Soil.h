/**
 * @class Soil
 * @brief Abstract base class representing soil in the State design pattern.
 *
 * The Soil class serves as an abstract base class for different soil states in the State design pattern. 
 * It defines the common interface for various concrete soil states and includes functionality for harvesting crops and handling rain.
 * Specific soil states like DrySoil, FloodedSoil, and FruitfulSoil inherit from this class and implement the specific behaviors.
 *
 * @tparam T Thereâ€™s no template method.
 *
 * @ingroup State Pattern
 *
 * @author Salome Kalaka
 * @date 09 September 2024
 *
 * @version 1.0
 *
 * @see Derived classes (DrySoil, FloodedSoil, FruitfulSoil), harvestCrops(), rain(), getName(), setName()
 * @todo Implement specific soil state behaviors in derived classes.
 *
 * @warning Ensure proper state transitions to avoid invalid soil conditions.
 *
 * @attention Derived classes must implement the pure virtual functions to define specific soil behaviors.
 *
 * @note The Soil class is part of a state machine that manages soil conditions in a farm environment.
