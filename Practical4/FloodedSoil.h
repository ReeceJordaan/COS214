/**
 * @class FloodedSoil
 * @brief A concrete state representing flooded soil in the State design pattern.
 *
 * FloodedSoil is one of the possible states of soil within the State design pattern. This state indicates that the soil is flooded, 
 * and it defines behaviors such as harvesting crops and reacting to further rain. When rain occurs, the state of the soil may change.
 *
 * @tparam T Thereâ€™s no template method.
 *
 * @ingroup State Pattern
 *
 * @implements This class is a concrete state and inherits from Soil.
 *
 * @author Salome Kalaka
 * @date 09 September 2024
 *
 * @version 1.0
 *
 * @see Soil class, harvestCrops(), rain()
 * @todo Implement transition to DrySoil or another state when conditions change.
 *
 * @warning Flooded soil may damage crops and impede harvesting.
 *
 * @attention Ensure proper handling of transitions between soil states to reflect accurate soil conditions.
 *
 * @note FloodedSoil is part of a larger state machine managing soil conditions in a farm environment.
