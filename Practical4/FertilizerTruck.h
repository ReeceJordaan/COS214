/**
 * @class FertilizerTruck
 * @brief A concrete observer class for trucks that deliver fertilizer in the Observer design pattern.
 *
 * FertilizerTruck is a concrete implementation of the Truck class, designed to deliver fertilizer based on the state of a CropField.
 * It observes changes in the CropField and reacts accordingly. The FertilizerTruck also maintains a reference to the current soil state, 
 * which may affect its operations.
 *
 * @tparam T Thereâ€™s no template method.
 *
 * @ingroup Observer Pattern
 *
 * @implements This class is a Concrete Observer and inherits from Truck.
 *
 * @author Salome Kalaka
 * @date 09 September 2024
 *
 * @version 1.0
 *
 * @see Truck class, CropField class, Soil class, startEngine()
 * @todo Implement specific logic for reacting to changes in the CropField and soil state.
 *
 * @warning Ensure the correct handling of fertilizer delivery based on soil conditions and crop field status.
 *
 * @attention Maintain synchronization between the truck, crop field, and soil state to ensure accurate operations.
 *
 * @note FertilizerTruck is part of an observer system where it reacts to changes in the CropField and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
