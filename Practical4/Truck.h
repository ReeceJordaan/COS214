/**
 * @class Truck
 * @brief Abstract base class representing a truck in the Observer design pattern.
 *
 * The Truck class serves as an abstract base class for various types of trucks in the Observer design pattern.
 * It defines the common interface for trucks that can observe and respond to changes in other objects (e.g., barns).
 * Derived classes must implement the `startEngine()` method to define specific behaviors for starting the truck's engine.
 *
 * @tparam T Thereâ€™s no template method.
 *
 * @ingroup Observer Pattern
 *
 * @author Salome Kalaka
 * @date 09 September 2024
 *
 * @version 1.0
 *
 * @see Derived classes (e.g., DeliveryTruck), startEngine()
 * @todo Implement specific truck behaviors in derived classes.
 *
 * @warning Ensure proper implementation of the `startEngine()` method to reflect accurate truck functionality.
 *
 * @attention Derived classes must provide concrete implementations for all pure virtual functions.
 *
 * @note The Truck class is part of an observer system where trucks may observe changes in other objects, such as barns.
