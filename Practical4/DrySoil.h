/**
 * @class DrySoil
 * @brief A concrete state representing dry soil in the State design pattern.
 *
 * DrySoil is one of the possible states of soil within the State design pattern. This state indicates that the soil is dry, 
 * and it defines behaviors such as harvesting crops and reacting to rain. When rain occurs, the state of the soil may change.
 *
 * @tparam T Thereâ€™s no template method.
 *
 * @ingroup State Pattern
 *
 * @implements This class is a concrete state and inherits from Soil.
 *
 * @author Salome Kalaka
 * @date 09 September 2024
 *
 * @version 1.0
 *
 * @see Soil class, harvestCrops(), rain()
 * @todo Implement transition to FruitfulSoil or another state when rain occurs.
 *
 * @warning Dry soil may result in lower crop yield during harvest.
 *
 * @attention Transitions between soil states must be handled properly to reflect real-world soil conditions.
 *
 * @note DrySoil is part of a larger state machine managing soil conditions in a farm environment.
