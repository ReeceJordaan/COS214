/**
 * @class FruitfulSoil
 * @brief A concrete state representing fruitful soil in the State design pattern.
 *
 * FruitfulSoil is one of the possible states of soil within the State design pattern. This state indicates that the soil is in an optimal condition for crop growth, 
 * and it defines behaviors such as harvesting crops and reacting to rain. When rain occurs, the soil state may transition to another condition if overwatered.
 *
 * @tparam T Thereâ€™s no template method.
 *
 * @ingroup State Pattern
 *
 * @implements This class is a concrete state and inherits from Soil.
 *
 * @author Salome Kalaka
 * @date 09 September 2024
 *
 * @version 1.0
 *
 * @see Soil class, harvestCrops(), rain()
 * @todo Implement transition to FloodedSoil or another state when excess rain occurs.
 *
 * @warning Overwatering may transition the soil to a less desirable state.
 *
 * @attention Ensure proper handling of state transitions to reflect accurate soil conditions and prevent crop damage.
 *
 * @note FruitfulSoil is part of a state machine managing soil conditions to optimize crop growth and harvest.
