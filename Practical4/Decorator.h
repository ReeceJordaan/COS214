/**
 * @class Decorator
 * @brief An abstract decorator class that adds additional functionality to FarmUnit objects.
 *
 * The Decorator class is responsible for dynamically adding new functionalities, such as increasing production, harvesting, and calculating storage capacity. 
 * This class is intended to be subclassed to provide specific implementations for different types of decorators.
 *
 * @tparam T Thereâ€™s no template method.
 *
 * @ingroup Pattern Wizards
 *
 * @implements This class is an abstract decorator and inherits from FarmUnit.
 *
 * @author Salome Kalaka
 * @date 09 September 2024
 *
 * @version 1.0
 *
 * @see FarmUnit class, harvest(), increaseProduction(), and getLeftoverCapacity()
 * @todo Implement specific decorators that inherit from this class.
 *
 * @warning No warning.
 *
 * @attention This class should not be instantiated directly; it serves as a base class for concrete decorators.
 *
 * @note The virtual functions must be implemented in subclasses.
